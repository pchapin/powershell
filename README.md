# PowerShell

This project contains my "PowerShell Body-of-Knowledge." It is a sandbox for learning PowerShell
and contains notes, sample scripts, and other things that I created during my studies. This is
not a single, coordinated project, but rather a collection of unrelated PowerShell experiments.
As my knowledge of PowerShell grows, I may organize this repository into a more structured
tutorial with the hope that it might be of value to others.
